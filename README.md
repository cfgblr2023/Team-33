This project repository aims to address the challenges faced by the LAMP Foundation. Our project endeavors to develop a comprehensive volunteer management system using a combination of React (front-end) and Django (back-end) technologies. The key objectives of our project include raising awareness among volunteers and students, and connecting students who have dropped out with volunteers who can assist them in mastering the foundational skills required to secure employment.

Our registration process caters to both students and volunteers, while the administration panel oversees three primary functionalities. The first feature involves verifying the credentials of both students and volunteers who are participating in the program. The second feature focuses on creating events in collaboration with volunteers, allowing students to enroll in these events. Lastly, the third feature revolves around making events available for all students to view and facilitating volunteer participation.

Additionally, we have developed a funding page where we encourage donors to support the noble cause of the LAMP Foundation and contribute towards empowering individuals in need of job opportunities to learn efficiently and achieve success in life.
